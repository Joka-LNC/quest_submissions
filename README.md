# Chapter 1 Day 1

Q1: Blockchain is a public database which anyone can view and interact with. It stores information and has no governing body

Q2: Smart Contract is a set of rules that allows developers to determine how a certain part of blockchain will be interacted with, and gives it functionality.

Q3: Transaction is used to change data on blockchain and has cost, while script is used to view data and has no cost.


# Chapter 1 Day 2

Q1: Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience and Resource Oriented Programming.

Q2: 5 pillars are useful because they make life easier for both users and developers. Developers can easily transition to it due to its similarity with other programming languages, and it's easy to debug. Users on the other hand can easily read the code because of it's clarity if they're checking the safety of a Contract.

# Chapter 2 Day 2
1. Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.
  changeGreeting is a function that will allow us to change data in smart contract, but doesn't hold actual data so script wouldn't have anything to read there.

2. What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
  AuthAccount is used to sign transactions and access data in users account
  
3. What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
  In prepare phase we are accessing the account data while in execute phase we can modify that data on blockchain.
